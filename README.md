# QUESTION
Develop a JavaScript script to implement a basic form that collects essential user information. The form should include fields for first name, last name, email address, user ID, and password. All fields are mandatory, and the email address must be in the correct format. Additionally, the password and confirm password fields should match. JavaScript validation should be implemented to ensure data integrity, with error messages displayed in red for each erroneous form field.


# JavaScript Form Validation: User Registration Form
Welcome to the JavaScript Form Validation project, designed to create a simple and interactive user registration form. This project is ideal for college students learning JavaScript and web development, offering a hands-on opportunity to implement essential form validation techniques.


## Features
- **Form Fields:** Collects essential user information including first name, last name, email address, user ID, and password.
- **Validation Rules:**
  - **Mandatory Fields:** All form fields are required.
  - **Email Format:** Ensures the email address is in the correct format.
  - **Password Matching:** Validates that the password and confirm password fields match.
- **Error Display:** Error messages are dynamically displayed in red color for each invalid form field, providing clear feedback to the user.


## How It Helps College Students
This project serves as a practical exercise for college students in JavaScript and web development:
- **Hands-On Learning:** Implement fundamental JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation and form validation.
- **Real-World Application:** Learn to create user-friendly forms with validation that enhance user experience and data integrity.
- **Customizable Code:** The code is open to all, encouraging students to explore, modify, and improve based on their learning and project requirements.
